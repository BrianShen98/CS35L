1.Download and decompress
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz


2.compile and install
 ./configure --prefix /u/eng/class/classjsh/Desktop/CS35L/lab3/coreutils-7.6
make
make install

3. reproduce bug
cd bin
I use ./ls -l to run the installed ls command.

4.patch
patch -p1 < Bpatch.diff    since the patch given has path a/src/ls.c
b/src/ls.c and a/NEWS b/News, I need to ignore one slash only to use the right
 path. So I use -p1.

5.
I typed make command. Then it exectues make all in lib, make all in src,
 make all in doc, make all in man, make all in po,
 make all in tests and make all in gnulib-tests.
 These commands have to be executed since after ls.c is changed,
 all the files related to ls.c need to be recompiled. And make command
find those files in the above folders.

6. 
I use touch testNew to create a file just modified and touch -t 199001010101
 testOld to create a file at least one year old. 
Then

I use src/ls -l testNew to get the correct output:
-rw-r--r-- 1 classjsh class 0 Apr 21 18:07 testNew

I use bin/ls -l testNew to get the wrong output:
-rw-r--r-- 1 classjsh class 0 2017-04-21 18:07 testNew

I use src/ls -l testOld to get the correct output:
-rw-r--r-- 1 classjsh class 0 Jan  1  1990 testOld

I use bin/ls -l testOld to get the wrong output:
-rw-r--r-- 1 classjsh class 0 1990-01-01 01:01 testOld

So after the patch, the ls behaves correctly.
And the difference between running correct ls command on the
 new file and a file older than a year is that the output will
not show the hour and minute the old file is created. It just show
the year, month and day when the old file is created.
