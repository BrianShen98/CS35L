Q1:
It is not necessary. This line does not have any prurpose. Brady deleted this
line since it is merely a repetition of the following line. And if he did not
delete this line, nothing will be changed.

Q2:
After the change, if a locale has no translation,
the timestamp will set to POSIX one,
which contains English words. So if users don't know English, they will
have trouble understanding the date.  

Q3:
The output is:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "./randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "./randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]
    # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

It shows an IndexError since in random module it defines that if seq is
empty, which is this case, it will return an IndexError.
Q4:
python 3 output a sytax error notation but python 2 will interpret seccessfully.
The reason is that python3 has merged
EnvironmentError, IOError,WindowsError, ect. into OSError.
So IOError is no longer available in python3.
