1.can use man -K 'theWordSpecified'. I searched man man to find it  

2. cp program located at usr/bin/cp, I use 'which' command to 
locate the program file.
wc program located at /usr/bin/wc, I use 'which' 
command to locate the program file.

3.w: show who is logged on and what they are doing
  [: bash builtin command
  X:(Xorg) is a full featured X server.

I used echo $PATH to find the directories that store those executables.
/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/u/eng/class/classjsh/
perl5/bin:/usr/lib64/ccache:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:
/usr/X11R6/bin:/u/eng/class/classjsh/bin

THen I use find *each path listed above* -name '?' -executable
to find all executables that have 1 character long.
In /usr/bin, I found three executable X, w,[. 
Then I use man w and man [ to find w and ['s functionality.
But I cannot open man X. So I use cd /usr/bin and ls -l X
to find that it is a symbolic link to Xorg. So I use man Xorg
to find X's functionality. 


4.the file /etc/alternatives/emacs is executed. I use
readlink /usr/bin/emacs to find the real file name pointed
to by the softlink.

5.g+s set the group ID for the specified file.
o-x remove the 'execute' permission for other
users that are not in the file's group
I found them in man chmod

6.find -mtime -21.
I found it in man find. -21 means last modified in 21*24 hours.

7.find ~/ -type d -mtime -21. I use man find to find the commmand.

8. 294 symbolic links.

 I first use 'which find' to locate the directory
of find. The output is /usr/bin/find. So I use 'find /usr/bin -type l'
to find all the symbolic links in that directory. And by reading the n
umber of lines shown at the bottom of the *shell command output*
buffer, I found there are 294 symbolic links in total. 

9. libfreeblpriv3.so is the oldest regular file in /usr/lib.

 I use 'man ls' to find that I should use ls -tl to print all files from
 newest to oldest. And since the file type of a regular file should
 be '-', so the first 
should be libfreeblpriv3.so.  

10. locale gets its data from locale difinition files whose default path is
/usr/share/i18n/locales. The locale definition files
 are compiled by localedef ,and the default path for compiled
 individual locale data files is /usr/lib/locale.
In other words, locale also gets its data from /usr/lib/locale.  

I first use 'man locale' to find that locale output setting based on the 
environment variables. And by using man -k locale, I found locale(7) and 
localedef(1) 
might be usefel since they contain the locale definition files. Then I use
 man 5 locale to find localdef compile all the definition file to 
form a database. Then I use man localedef to find the default locale 
definition file location.

11. 
Buffer-menu-sort	      M-x ... RET
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column at point.
sort-columns		      M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region alphabetically by a certain range of columns.
sort-fields		      M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region lexicographically by the ARGth field of each
   line.
sort-lines		      M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-numeric-fields	      M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region numerically by the ARGth field of each line.
sort-pages		      M-x ... RET
   Sort pages in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-paragraphs		      M-x ... RET
   Sort paragraphs in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-regexp-fields	      M-x ... RET
   Sort the text in the region region lexicographically.
tabulated-list-col-sort	      M-x ... RET
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column of the mouse click E.
tabulated-list-sort	      M-x ... RET
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column at point.

I use C-h a then enter the string 'sort' to find all commands
 that have sort in their names.

12.C-M-a: move backward to the beginning of a defun.
C-M b: move backward across one balanced expression.
C-M c: Exit from the innermost recursive edit or minibuffer.
C-M d: Move forward down one level of parentheses.
C-M e: Move forward to next end of defun.
C-M f: Move forward across one balanced expression (sexp).
C-M g: Does not exist. Will show the explanation of C-g
C-M h: Put mark at end of this defun, point at beginning.
The defun marked is the one that contains point or follows point.

I use C-h k to find the explanation.

13.C-g:
Signal a `quit' condition.
During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly.
At top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps.

I use C-h k C-g to find it.
 
14.Reinsert ("paste") the last stretch of killed text.
I use C-h f yank to find it.

15. the output of dired contain two more entries: curruent directory
 and parent 
directory(. and ..). And the first line in dired will 
print out total 345824, available 11769808, while ls -l only print 
out total amount.

I use cd/usr/bin and  C-x d and ls -l to find the result.
